SS Optimized Play Guide
=======================

### Story Mode
Story mode is easily the one of the most profitable areas to farm.
Farming with full managers on 5-1 yields up to 2400 gold and 1.1 gp per st spent and is good value even compared to minions.
Ideally you farm ~~4~~2 st mission matches (up to 5-2), and you farm the highest match you can ohko with an activeless mid striker.
Clovers are important to maintain a high drop rate, as is Jiho ace as the legend with the highest potential clover count.
It's also important to include a frontline striker as a fallback in case the ball slips from your mid striker.

### CoD
![CoD Formation](https://github.com/horologix/ssminmax/blob/master/img/formationcod.png)

A CoD ohko formation should be able to clear 45 levels on auto (blocked by 46's Nono).
Alternatively a formation with a gk can potentially go much higher, but will result in a lower score.
CoD is farmable in this way, clearing 45 floors for every reset.

### DBoss
![DBoss Formation](https://github.com/horologix/ssminmax/blob/master/img/formationdboss.png)

DBoss matches can be played on auto.
Other people are quite helpful with DBoss, which means you don't necessarily have to solo matches.
A successful auto formation consists of numerous assists which constantly cycle the ball front for shots.
The AI is expectedly atrocious, but is generally enough to land shots over time.

### Formations
You will need at least 4 formations for the 3 modes above, and PvP.
All of these matches are played on auto so make sure they play effectively under AI.

### Dispatch
You can use the same 4 dispatch slots for all your missions while the other 5 dispatch slots can be used to ban out missions with poor rewards.
This is the end result of always picking the best missions to do anyways, so you might as well reroll the worst missions to not do instead.

### Managers
![Managers](https://github.com/horologix/ssminmax/blob/master/img/managersets.png)

It's recommended you have at least 5 manager sets for efficiency.
You will need sets for Idle, PvE, Farming, Selling, and Dispatch.
As a side note, because Santa Selena will be switched in whenever using actives, Sigmund will always use Santa Selena's active.
Also because of this, never put Santa Selena on the second slot.
#### Idle Manager Set
Idle set is the default set when not playing, and should be stacked with ST recovery managers and Lucy (for away games).
This set can also double as your default PvP set.
Santa Selena has very powerful active GP/ST gain and can be combined with Sigmund to good effect.
__Recommended:__ Santa Selena, Lucy, 2x Stat Managers, Ingram, Sigmund.
#### PvE Manager Set
PvE set has a focus in reducing BP costs and increasing champ rate, and will have Santa Selena, Yukata Eve, Aaron, with the rest being filed by stat/st active managers.
__Recommended:__ Santa Selena, Lucy, 2x Stat Managers, Yukata Eve, Aaron.
#### Farm Manager Set
Farm set focuses on increasing droprate and reducing ST consumption.
Because you should be farming 4st story missions, you only need 40% ST reduction for the cost to round down to 2st.
This leaves an extra trainer slot for a ST recovery manager which gets procced by Ingram.
__Recommended:__ Magnolia, Perial, ST Recovery Manager, Hazel, Ingram, Sigmund. __Alternatives:__ Halloween Eve, Korean Selena.
#### Selling Manager Set
Sell set has managers which increase your sell value. Per usual, the other slots are filled with ST recovery.
__Recommended:__ Wedding Eve, Mave, 2x ST Recovery Managers, Ingram, Sigmund. __Alternatives:__ Maya
#### Dispatch Manager Set
Dispatch set has managers for reducing dispatch duration. Per usual, the other slots are filled with ST recovery.
__Recommended:__ Bunny Eve, Lelorence, 2x ST Recovery Managers, Ingram, Sigmund.
